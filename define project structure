Explanation of Each Folder and File
src/:

This directory contains all the source code and resources of the project, divided into application (main) and test (test) components.
src/main/java/:

This folder holds the main Java source code files.
You should create packages here to organize your code logically. For example, com.example.idkjdk might contain the main application class, Main.java.
src/main/resources/:

This folder is for configuration and other resource files your application might need, like application.properties or XML files.
Maven includes this directory in the application’s classpath during the build, making these resources accessible to your Java classes.
src/test/java/:

This directory is dedicated to Java test code, such as unit tests or integration tests, organized similarly to the src/main/java folder.
Test classes (e.g., MainTest.java) help verify the functionality of your main application code, using tools like JUnit.
pom.xml:

The POM (Project Object Model) file is central to any Maven project, controlling project configuration, dependency management, and build settings.
Inside pom.xml, you specify project dependencies (like JUnit or Spring Boot), plugins, and build configurations.
For example, Maven automatically downloads dependencies listed in pom.xml, ensuring that all developers and environments use the same libraries.
