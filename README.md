Food Recipe Sharing and Rating System


Project Overview
The Food Recipe Sharing and Rating System is a Java-based web application designed to bring food enthusiasts together by allowing users to share, rate, and discover recipes. The platform provides an engaging environment where users can post recipes, leave ratings, and add comments on each recipe. Using Maven for dependency management and project configuration, this system is structured to streamline development and deployment.

Features
User Registration and Authentication:
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles to track their own recipes and interactions with other users’ content.

Recipe Posting and Sharing:
Users can create and publish recipes with details like ingredients, preparation instructions, and photos. Recipes are stored in the database, accessible to all users.

Rating System:
Users can rate recipes on a scale of 1 to 5. This system helps identify top-rated recipes and provides valuable feedback to recipe creators.

Commenting:
Users can leave comments on recipes, encouraging interaction, questions, and feedback within the community.

Recipe Categorization:
Recipes can be tagged with categories such as Desserts, Pasta, or Vegetarian, making it easy for users to filter and find recipes based on their interests.

Search and Browse:
Users can search recipes by title, ingredients, or category, and explore popular or recent recipes.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interface.
Backend: Java (using Spring Boot, if applicable) for server-side logic.
Database: MySQL for data storage and management.
Build Tool: Maven for dependency management and project configuration.
Maven Project Structure
