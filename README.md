#Food Recipe Sharing and Rating System


Project Overview
The Food Recipe Sharing and Rating System is a web application designed to create a community where users can share, rate, and discover recipes. This platform enables users to post their own recipes, rate othersâ€™ recipes, and leave comments, fostering a collaborative environment for food enthusiasts. The system also features a categorization mechanism to make recipe discovery easy and engaging.

Features
User Registration and Authentication:
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles to keep track of their posted recipes and interactions with other users' recipes.

Recipe Sharing:
Users can create, edit, and share recipes with details like ingredients, instructions, and photos. Recipes are stored in the database, allowing them to be viewed by all users.

Rating System:
Users can rate each recipe on a scale of 1 to 5. This rating system enables easy identification of top-rated recipes and provides feedback for recipe authors.

Commenting:
Users can leave comments on recipes, encouraging feedback, questions, and interaction within the community.

Categorization of Recipes:
Recipes can be tagged with categories like Desserts, Pasta, Vegetarian, and more, making it easy for users to filter and find recipes based on their preferences.
